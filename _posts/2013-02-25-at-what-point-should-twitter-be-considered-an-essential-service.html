<p>I’m still processing a lot of my research last summer into the Business of Twitters API. My goal is to explore all aspects of what I feel is one of the single most important API platforms around today. I wanted to explore thoughts on when Twitter should be considered an essential service or utility. You know, like water, electricity and phone. Don’t get me wrong here, I’m not advocating for yet more government, but exploring potential solutions to some of the problems we face when depending on the Twitter. I wanted to understand more about at what point does a product or service, moves beyond a want, and enters into the need category. When does government tend to step in and make sure products continue being made and ensuring that some services are too essential to stop providing under any circumstances. To begin, I wanted to understand what a public utility was. According to Answers.com, a public utility is: A private business organization, subject to governmental regulation, that provides an essential commodity or service, such as water, electricity, transportation, or communication, to the public. Ok. I’d put Twitter into the communication bucket, but is a Tweet a commodity, and is Twitter essential? Well, what is an essential service? According to Wikipedia, essential services are: Essential services may refer to a class of occupations that have been legislated by a government to have special restrictions in regard to labour actions - Such as not being allowed to legally strike. Interesting, concept around being able to legally strike? Twitter is pretty critical tool in any type of political organizing like striking and protesting--which could add a whole new layer to this conversation. Some direct examples of essential services are police and fire department, with other vital services being phone, radio and tv. Twitter has grown beyond any previous definition of what is a communication channel.  Again, according to Wikipedia, a public utility is: A public utility (usually just utility) is an organization that maintains the infrastructure for a public service (often also providing a service using that infrastructure). Public utilities are subject to forms of public control and regulation ranging from local community-based groups to state-wide government monopolies. (Common arguments in favor of regulation include the desire to control market power, facilitate competition, promote investment or system expansion, or stabilize markets. In general, though, regulation occurs when the government believes that the operator, left to his own devices, would behave in a way that is contrary to the community's best interests.) This is all just an excercise for me. Meant to help me understand where the boundaries are and give me an excuse to better understand the history of essential services and public utilities. While I think there are patterns between communication with Twitter and communication via phone or radio, there are also entirely new sets of questions that need asking when it comes to the virtual space, beyond the questions we are used to asking in the physical world. We have to come up with entirely new models to deal with essential services where in one instance the service could be the product, like with social and big data, and in alternate situations, the lack of platform access could mean the difference between life or death in a hurricane or in the upheaval of a government--all via the same platform. There are some very important questions that need to be asked when it comes to the access of Twitter data, and the availability of the platform when there are heavy rate limits in place, meant to keep the platform up and running, but ultimately can restrict access to potentially vital public data. Although I’m very early in my research, at this point I think we can call Twitter an essential service. It needs to remain up, and the data that flows through the pipes need to remain openly accessible via any client and through the API. Twitter admits that the rate limit is “a more effective ways to reduce load and ensure that the Twitter service remains available to the greatest number of users”. It seems to me that it is time to find a new approach to Twitter data access via the API and possibly discussing a more distributed approach to operating Twitter--one that will allow them to maintain the control and monetization they desire, but ensures access and uptime for everyone. With Twitter fast becoming the pulse of the planet, I guess, my original question stands: At what point should Twitter be considered an essential service?</p>

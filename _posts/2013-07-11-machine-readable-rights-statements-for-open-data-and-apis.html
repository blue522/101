<p>I'm getting educated about various data standardization efforts that are currently under way. Todays lesson is from the <a href="http://theodi.org/">Open Data Institute</a> (ODI), around <a title="providing machine readable rights statements for open data and APIs" href="http://theodi.org/blog/machine-readable-rights-statements">providing machine readable rights statements for open data and APIs</a>.</p>
<p>ODI's work on rights statements is based on the concept that when data is published on the web, it should be accompanied by machine-readable metadata that describes various aspects including content, origin, publication schedule and clear licensing.</p>
<p>While there are other efforts to standardize dataset metadata, including the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/#class-dataset)">W3C Data Catalog Vocabulary</a> (DCAT), ODI is working specifically on new vocabulary for what they are calling "Open Data Rights Statements", which includes:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>License for the dataset</li>
<li>Copyright notices</li>
<li>Attribution that acknowledge sources</li>
</ul>
<p>And are working on guides for both publishers and re-users on:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>How to link to rights statements from both web pages and APIs</li>
<li>How to publish machine-readable rights statements as RDFa</li>
</ul>
<p>The next generation of API discovery will be a balance of technology, business and politics. Machine readable Open Data Rights Statements will provide essential components for the layer that is the politics of open APIs and data. Meaning you don't want to search for all API and datasets on specific topic, you want all APIs and datasets that fits a specific licensing model and attribution requirements that match your project goals.</p>
<p>While there is a lot of work still to be done, it makes me happy that there are smart people out there working on these definitions. As ODI progresses, and I learn more, I will publish more stories to keep you up to speed. If you want to get more directly involved, <a href="http://github.com/theodi/open-data-licensing">the project is being run on Github</a>, and you can submit comments and issues there.</p></p>

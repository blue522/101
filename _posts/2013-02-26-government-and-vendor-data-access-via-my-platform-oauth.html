<p>
I&rsquo;m working through some thoughts from API Strategy &amp; Practice, around OAuth.  I just wrote a post asking which of the three OAuth legs is most important?  As I work through these thoughts, I&rsquo;m also working through another post about platform transparency reports becoming default.
As a venn diagram between security, privacy and transparency emerges in my mind, I can&rsquo;t help but wonder why two important areas of resource access via popular platforms are not housed under the OAuth roof.
When we think of OAuth we consider the three legs being server, client and user, with the client often being a developer.  Seems to me there are two other clients:

Government - Should government requests for information reside within the realm of my OAuth.  When I login to my Twitter, visit settings &gt; apps, I should see any government requests for information with each agency and the information requested.  Right?
Vendor or Partner - A company should be required to disclose where any personally identifiable information is shared. &nbsp;Providing me access into where my infformation is sold or shared within a company and its relationships.

I&rsquo;m not looking to further muddy the OAuth conversation.  Just as I&rsquo;m thinking about how to educate the average user about OAuth, hopefully shifting the power into their hands--I wanted to deeply understand how we can further empower everyone to truly own their data in this increasingly API driven, big data economy.
OAuth isn't just technical. &nbsp;It is something every Internet user needs to understand. &nbsp;We need to get to work educating all three legs of the OAuth chain, about best practices.</p>

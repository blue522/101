<p>Juddge Alsup finally came in with an official ruling on whether or not APIs are copyrightable: The overall name tree, of course, has creative elements but it is also a precise command structure â€” a utilitarian and functional set of symbols, each to carry out a pre-assigned function. This command structure is a system or method of operation under Section 102(b) of the Copyright Act and, therefore, cannot be copyrighted. Duplication of the command structure is necessary for interoperability. They are breaking down the filing over at Groklaw, I recommend heading over there to join in. Its at least a good legal line in the sand, helping keep APIs as open as possible.</p>

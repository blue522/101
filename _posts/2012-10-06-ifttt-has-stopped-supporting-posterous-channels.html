<p>I got an email from IFTTT last night, simply stating:  As of today, IFTTT has stopped supporting the Posterous Channel. The Channel has been removed, along with any Recipes that made use of Posterous Triggers or Actions.  If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at support@ifttt.com. Thanks for your continued support.  —The IFTTT Team  This announcement, follows a similar one a couple weeks ago, where IFTT also ceased support for channels that pull your data from Twitter.   Since Posterous is owned by Twitter, it's easy to see the parallels in the decision by IFTTT.  </p>

<p>I am working through some thoughts on the usage of the term “open”, when branding, launching and marketing your API. When you use the term “open” to describe your API, which of these three legs are you refering to? Platform - You are opening up your API to the public Developer - The API is open for developers to use User - The API is open to allow end users access to their data Maybe open is a combination of all of those? If any of those areas apply to your APIs definition of open, which of the three area is most important and delivers the most value to your business? I’m working on what I’d call the "varying degrees of open", and applying some of this to my API stack ranking to reward APIs for using “open” appropriately, and penalize for using inappropriately..</p>

I talked yesterday about the Twitter API integration I&rsquo;m doing for my API Evangelist ranking and monitoring system.  Long story short is I&rsquo;m trying to get a large volume of Tweets from a large number of Twitter accounts for use in my ranking and monitoring algorithm, and for display on API, service provider and hackathon detail pages.
Last night I started pulling Tweets for just one of my data points:  Twitter accounts of 900+ APIs.
Using the Twitter REST API, I&rsquo;m allowed to make 350 authenticated calls per hour, with each call I can get 200 Tweets.  Using the Twitter statuses/user_timeline, I am pulling an average of 1000 tweets per user.  So each user is approximately 5 calls, and I was able to process 70 APIs before I hit my limit.
With 830 more API Twitter handles to process, one can quickly see that the REST API will not get me what I need.  I would need to run 13 separate servers to be able to get my Twitter data for the APIs.  And this is just one of my data points.
As Taylor Singletary (@episod) from Twitter tweeted this morning:

@kinlane You'll likely get by just fine with just Streaming API's filter/follow. It takes a lot of tweets to encompass 1% of the firehose.

The Twitter REST API will not provide the access I need, and deliver the data I need for my API ranking and monitoring system.  So next step is to write code that uses the Twitter Streaming API, and see what kind of access it provides me for my startup.</p>

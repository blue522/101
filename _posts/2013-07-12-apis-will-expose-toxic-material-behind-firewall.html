     I spend a lot of time thinking of reasons that will convince business and government leaders to adopt an API approach to their operations. In contrast I also think a lot about why these same business and government leaders would not want to put APIs to use.
</p>
<p>
     Some of the top level reasons, businesses and governments do not get on the API train:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Not educated about them
     </li>
     <li>Lack of technology resources
     </li>
     <li>No proven track record within their world
     </li>
     <li>It is just a fad, and will soon pass
     </li>
     <li>Security concerns
     </li>
     <li>Branding concerns
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     Beyond the open reasons, some of the more darker reasons might be:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Corruption
     </li>
     <li>Incompetency
     </li>
     <li>Illegal behavior
     </li>
     <li>Vapor wares
     </li>
     <li>Existing exploitation
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     Us technologists love to believe, that in any broken industry, all you need to do is add the right technology and poof, everything is fixed. But in reality, many business and government leaders will not want to open the kimono and let you see anything that is really going on behind the scenes.
</p>
<p>
     Thinking about these realities, how can we entice and incentivize these leader into incremental shifts, toward APIs in a way that will feed their motivations?
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Cost savings
     </li>
     <li>Efficiencies
     </li>
     <li>Competitiveness
     </li>
     <li>Public demand
     </li>
     <li>Make them with regulation
     </li>
     <li>Shadow operations
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     These are just a few of the ways we can slowly shift companies and government agencies to think more open and consider opening up API programs. However even if these approaches work, unlike the vision of many technologists, things will not be immediately good. There will be a lot of unforeseen consequences of opening up companies and our government using APIs.

     Switching from the kimono analogy to a dam reference. Many of these companies and government agencies we are looking to open up with APIs, and open data, have been in existence for a very long time. There is a lot of legacy process, data, resources and exhaust built up behind these "firewalls". Much like we face when we <a href="http://www.michigancapitolconfidential.com/17693">breach dams across the country</a>, we open up new possibilities of stirring up toxic sediment, that can have unseen repercussions across companies, industries or even how our markets and governments operate.
</p>
<p>
     This isn't a reason to avoidÂ APIs, this is just a cautionary tale. Not every API will result in good. When you start poking holes or completely breaching a company or government firewall, and letting sunlight and oxygen in, there is no way to tell what will happen next.
</p>
<p>
     Be thoughtful!

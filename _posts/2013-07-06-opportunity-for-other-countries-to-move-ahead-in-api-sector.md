     As I watch the existing NSA relationships with technology companies unfold, I can't help but see opportunity for companies in other countries to use this as an opportunity to move ahead in the technology race.
</p>
<p>
     Our government has dealt a severe blow to the vitality of the US tech scene. When anyone in the world goes to adopt a new API, they will start to ask questions like: Where are my valuable be resources being stored? What relationship does this company have with the US government?
</p>
<p>
     While this has the potential to be very bad for US tech companies in establishing trust with customers, there is massive opportunity for other countries to step up and lead in a very meaningful way when it comes to delivering web services.
</p>
<p>
     APIs open up huge opportunities for interoperability. It would be very easy for companies, that operate in countries who have healthier privacy policies, to take the API design and business models of popular API resources and offer customers a safer, secure alternative.
</p>
<p>
     I can even see the potential for some sort of certification that provides a badge to companies who actively protect users privacy and take a stance against some of the practices we are discovering occurring between tech companies and the NSA.
</p>
<p>
     I don't say this to undermine US technology. I say this because these vital resources, like messaging, imaging, videos are critical to our daily lives and for the global API economy to evolve in a healthy way, privacy and security needs to be respected. If this can't be achieved on US soil, it needs to happen elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
     Trust is an essential ingredient in the unfolding API driven society that unfolding. For this to work we must balance transparency, privacy and security in a partnership between tech companies and the countries they reside in.

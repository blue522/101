<p>I see the term "open API" used a lot out there in the API space. I feel there are truly very few actual open APIs, but the term has been co-opted by the media, many API owners as well as API service providers. The only two open APIs I can think of, off the top of my head are: Wikipedia OpenStreeMaps Iâ€™m sure there are more, but will have to do some more research to identify them. So what makes an open API? Publicly Accessible Open / Self-Service Access Read and Write Capabilities Data Openly Licensed Interface Openly Licensed Those seem like a few of the obvious ones, what else am I missing? Many companies are actively using the term "open API", when they should be using the term "public API". I think many companies could easily make the choice to truly be open, but choose to just use it as a marketing term, rather than in a literal sense. Let's call APIs what they are really are, "public APIs".</p>

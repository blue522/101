<p>
I wanted to have a better grasp of approximately how much money Twitter has raised to date, and who these investors are. &nbsp;This investment has allowed Twitter to grow, and these investors significantly influence Twitter, when it comes to monetization and the fate of the developer ecosystem.
Using Crunchbase, Wikipedia and Google I was able to reconstruct the following Twitter investment timeline:

The low end of investment in Twitter is $1B and the high end probably looks like $1.5B, with 22 separate individuals and companies. &nbsp;With Union Square Ventures and Spark Capital investing 3 times each, and&nbsp;Benchmark Capital,&nbsp;Charles River Ventures,&nbsp;Digital Garage and&nbsp;Institutional Venture Partners investing 2 times a piece. &nbsp;Most recent investments involve record breaking amounts, at a staggering $8B+ valuation with a Russian tycoon and Saudi Prince.
I'm sure there are more investors and investments. &nbsp;If I missed anything let me know. &nbsp;
When you look at Twitter from this perspective, its easier to imagine the pressure Twitter must be under to deliver something for investors. &nbsp;</p>

<p>
I was writing a story on Nike&rsquo;s new Sustainable Products Index API for API Evangelist, and beyond the business use of the API I noticed the interesting licensing Nike decide to use for the data and the API:

This data is bound by the Open Database License (ODbL) v1.0
The API is bound by the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 2.1

Its good to see Nike license this important data under ODbL, allowing developers to freely share, create and adapt as long as you attribute, share-alike and keep the data open.
It was also interesting to see Nike license the API itself under the GNU license, keeping the API interface free and accessible for other people to use, keeping setting a publicly accessible standard for sustainable products index APIs.</p>

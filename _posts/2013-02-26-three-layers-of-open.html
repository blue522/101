<p>  Picture Credit: PyroGeeks There was a lot of discussion at the API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference last week about what is open? Ranging from Steve Klabnik’s keynote on why open, to late night, IPA fueled discussions about all the layers and depth of the word “open”. There was a great post on the API rating agency about what is open, which breaks it down into three main groups: Access and Authentication A developer portal to make it easy to register API design to make it easy to use Authentication protocol to access to a data The business model and the price of the APIkey Freedom and Re-Usabilty Having Terms of Service well explained and simple to understand Letting it hackable with no restrictions to specific use cases Not to say that you have the right to revoke anybody for any reason Neutrality Access Transparency Policy, Rate Limits and TOS Quality of Service Without Tiering Open is often confused with being publicly available, and the act of launching a technical API public, is by default "open". When in reality open is much more of a philosophical and ethical debate that can vary widely depending on each APIs perspective and the relationship it has with its community. The API Rating Agency offers up some important detail, that I will use to help communicate what is open to current and aspiring API providers. Hopefully we can all find a balance that will keep things healthy.</p>

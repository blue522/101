<p>Over the last two weeks I&rsquo;ve read a lot of negative comments about Twitter developers, centered around as Anil Dash puts it, &ldquo;a hippie utopian open protocol&rdquo;.  That all developers want is something for free, and somehow we should get over ourselves and move on.
Now that Twitter is moving closer to having total control over it&rsquo;s ecosystem, endpoints and the Twitter clients, let&rsquo;s stop and look at what the ecosystem has contributed:


@reply
#hashtag
Retweet
Search
Lists from&nbsp;Twibes and TweepML
In-Line Images
iPhone Client - Atebits (Tweetie)
Android Client
Mac Desktop Client - Atebits
Windows Desktop Client - TweetDeck
Buttons and Embeddables - Tweetmeme
URL Shortening - TinyURL and bit.ly

These are just a few of the notable things I&rsquo;ve written down while doing my Twitter research.  If there are any others I&rsquo;ve missed, let me know.  Some of the innovation in the Twitter ecosystem even goes beyond Twitter, like the pull to refresh functionality we now use on many iPhone apps.
Twitter acquired several of these key technologies from the ecosystem (as they should), but many others they went ahead and adopted and incorporated into the core Twitter we now know today without acquisition.  I just can&rsquo;t imagine thinking, the ecosystem is not capable of innovation anymore and everything should be created by Twitter--when you remember the full history of Twitter.
May I should start writing a post about every new API, who desperately is seeking developers to use their brand new resource, and complain about how they just want everything for free, and are living in some sort of hippie API utopia?  Or maybe we can just live in reality, and realize API owners need developers, and developers need APIs--and get back to business of doing this right, and striking a balance.</p>
